-Create a Class Library that validates US phone numbers with and without area codes. 
-Create a Test project that ensures the Class Library works as expected.
Match only validly formatted US phone numbers. Return true if a phone number is valid. Return false if a phone number is provided,
but is invalid.
Throw an exception if a null or empty phone number is supplied. Ensure the exception provides a good error message. 
Write at least one test in your Test project to ensure the expected exception is thrown 
(DO NOT throw System.Exception – pick a correct subtype). 

Hint: Use the ExpectedException attribute to detect that an exception occurs when expected.

Ensure that your tests actually confirm that the implementation works as expected. Test with as many different phone number formats 
as you think are necessary.
